In this moment a part of studies use Octave and JS.

You can try use some simple functions like Linear Regression using ALS in "rm.m", or simple perceptron in "perceptron.m" or a multi layer perceptron in directory "ann".

In "decks train" has a simple example of artificial neural. Pay attention, when you use that code because it is not stopping with error, that idea is for showing all historic of error including in overfitting.
